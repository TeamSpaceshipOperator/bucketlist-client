User stories:
  User Stories: I can get suggestions for restaurants.
  I can save suggestions to a list.
  I can delete from my list.
  I can access reviews.
  I can search for new restaurants in my area.
  I can see information about restaurants.
  I can save notes about a restaurant.
  I can search by location and keyword.

Stretch:
  I can view other users lists.
  I can sort my list.


We decided that a list of restaurants would be a delicious idea. To support this,
we chose to integrate with Yelp for a robust search feature and access to data.
Using scrum methodology, we split tasks up between the team, either pair
programming or tackling simple features solo.

Unsolved problems:
  -Add ability to view other users lists
  -Increase amount of restaurant information available
  -Add select random restaurant from list button

  Cheers,
       <=>
